My name is Alex Dolphin and since May 2020 I have been taking a career break.

After 2 weeks I started feeling as if I am not achieving anything, but when I
reflected harder I realised I had achieved and developed more than I was giving
myself credit for.

Although the primary purpose of this blog is to help myself reflect on my progress, I hope it brings you some entertainment and useful information along the way.

My regular activities are quite varied: cooking,exercising, studying in the
field of Data Science, gaming, and occassionally flying my drone. In my posts
you can see my progress on each of them and I would be grateful for anyone
willing to spur me on!
