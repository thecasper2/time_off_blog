<p>In my brief visit to the South of Germany I did a second drone flight in the
area of Neuschwanstein Castle.</p>
<p>Without too much history
<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/FHMN3t3zmZHh5DKq5">the castle</a>
was built in the late 1800s on a rugged
hill near the Austrian border in Bavarian Germany. It’s quite a popular tourist
landmark given that it’s a very picturesque region set just before the Alps,
and has an almost Disney-style appearance.</p>
<p>The castle was closed due to Coronavirus, so I thought it was a good opportunity
to fly the drone without the risk of large numbers of people around. I couldn’t
fly too close to the castle due to the nature of the landscape and just respect
for the local farmland, but nevertheless I got some nice video footage as you
can see below:</p>

<p>As the weather was great and there is so much beautiful landscape around the
area I decided to do a quick second flight next to
<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/JpMtRL6u4KQnWCKu9">Forggensee</a>,
a large lake nearby with a spectacular turquoise colour.</p>
