Today Thomas and I embarked on a cycling adventure to the Neanderthal museum.
I rounded it off by making some lemon drizzle cake (there is a video!) and
then making vegetarian Swedish meatballs for dinner.

For those of you who are desperately waiting for some hardcore statistics as I
promised in the introduction post then I can only apologise. Tomorrow I'm back
on the studying so I suspect you'll be treated to the pitfalls of interpreting
effect sizes in a day or two.

# Neanderthal

27 degrees is starting to become a fairly normal spring day in DÃ¼sseldorf I
have noticed in recent years, but it does make cycling a bit more interesting.
[Thomas](https://www.instagram.com/thomaspiauley/) and I embarked on a
[40km round cycle](https://www.strava.com/activities/3488352451)
to the Neanderthal museum.

My bike isn't doing so well at the moment as one of the gear shifters snapped
off. I can only gear down which was ideal for the uphills, but somewhat
frustrating for the numerous downhills. Nevertheless we chilled out outside the
museum and
[enjoyed a beer](https://untappd.com/user/thecasper2/checkin/897811172).

# Lemon Drizzle Cake

There was a bonus in the meal planning this week: lemon drizzle cake. I was
following
[this recipe](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/262234/best-ever-lemon-drizzle-cake/)
I found online and the results were fairly pleasing. If you want to see me
making it, look no further:

# Vegetarian Swedish Meatballs

And finally, in this somewhat eventful day, I made vegetarian Swedish
meatballs for dinner. The sauce is a bit questionable, maybe because I used a
low-quality stock, but overall I'm still quite happy with the dish. For those
interested
[here is the recipe](https://pinchofyum.com/vegetarian-swedish-meatballs).
