I have travelled down from the mountains, passing by Lake Garda, finally
stopping in fair Verona, where we lay our scene.

In this post not only do I want to relay the beauty of Lake Garda and the charm
of Verona, but also share a more relevant story of trying to run a hostel in
times of Coronavirus.

# Lake Garda

After descending through the mountains, a nice casual drive through a series
of hillside vineyards, passing by Trento, I reached Lake Garda with just enough
time to swim and enjoy some lunch.

The lake is a beautiful colour and the water is clearly clean, probably the
appeal for the local Italian tourists and German and Dutch alike. Driving down
the east side of the lake there were ample places to stop and relax and swim,
staying further from the towns and villages makes it a little quieter.

I stopped in a little town called
[Malcesine](https://goo.gl/maps/xptpUpr1UZrLo5JN8) which, although very pleasant
and well situated on the lake, is clearly aimed at attracting tourists with
a number of souvenir shops and restaurants.

I didn't get to stay too long before heading to Verona. In hindsight I wish
I had booked 1 night on the lake to enjoy the swimming a little more.

# The Hostello

[The Hostello](https://goo.gl/maps/S9f2EHjkFpDKikW98) is a charming hostel on
the east side of Verona in Veronetta. The owners are very friendly and 
hospitable and couldn't give me enough things like wine and melon. They have a
very nice garden which is ideal for relaxing during the hot weather and the
evening, and also have a beautiful and friendly cat called Mercutio who also
seems to own the place.

It has been open for about 2 years now and it sounds like things were going
really well, regularly being fully-booked in the warmer months to a total of
44 guests. Of course all that changed in early March when they were forced to
close for 4 months due to Coronavirus. To put that into context if it were full
in that time then guests would have paid for over 5000 nights.

If that wasn't tough enough, approximately 4 weeks ago there was
[flooding in Verona](https://www.news1.news/en/2020/06/weather-violent-clouds-over-verona-and-padua-veneto-cause-flooding-and-considerable-damage-the-video-of-the-event.html)
which caused significant damage to a newly-refurbished games and recreation room
they had in the basement.

Predicting if business is likely to improve soon is tougher than it sounds. Last
year approximately half the tourists were living in Europe, and half from
outside. It's possible the hostel could have been full with only European guests
but it is hard to say. The situation now makes it unlikely for non-Europeans to
visit Italy, it seems especially unlikely that many US visitors will make it to
Europe this summer.

That being said with Schengen borders being reopened and a renewed interest
in short-haul travel it seems to me that there is a possibility there may be
an increasing number of guests coming from northern Europe such as myself. For
anyone with the ability to travel around the continent I would say now seems
like a great time. The tourism industry is suffering, and many tourist
attractions are much less busy than usual. It is also much easier to see local
culture in action and it definitely won't last long until tourists return in
full force.

For anyone interested in staying in Verona I can thoroughly recommend
[The Hostello](https://www.thehostello.com/) if they plan to stay open.

# Verona

Verona is a small city which I was informed is slowly developing a younger
culture. There are an abundance of restaurants, bars, and gelaterie, but the
most prominent sight is the preserved Roman Amphitheatre, Verona Arena.

Built in AD 30 it is still used as an opera venue to this day. Although it has
been closed in recent months, it seems that the arena is once again accessible
to tourists. It is also flanked by rows of colourful and surprisingly
well-priced restaurants.

Another popular attraction that I didn't visit inside is Juliet's house, yes
the Juliet of Romeo & Juliet. Although I didn't find out much about the house,
I did observe that there are far fewer visitors than the pictures on Google
show.

There is also a nice statuette of Juliet in the courtyard.

A very nice way to see the city with a broad view is to climb the Torre dei
Lamberti. It costs â‚¬8 to climb to the top and that includes a ticket to the
art gallery adjacent to it. The climb is 368 steps but there is also an elevator
in case that seems a little daunting. You can see my climb below.

The view is excellent and you can even see the mountains in the distance.

Finally to round off a nice visit I was recommended to view the city from
[Castel San Pietro](https://goo.gl/maps/PYHNdkvjoHy3ARCy7). It is possible
to take a funicular railway up to the Castel but I simply took the stairs. The
view from the top is equally as spectacular as the tower and apparently offers
a great view of the sunset. Unfortunately I didn't hang around long enough to
see that.

Overall Verona is a charming city which is easy to visit in a single day.
