<p>Yesterday I entered Italy and left the German-speaking nations behind; or so I
thought until I encountered a very strange dialect of German in South Tyrol.
My tent finds itself located in Colfosco among the peaks of the Dolomites.</p>
<p>I have a nice selection of panoramic photos and drone footage among mountains
and a nice hiking tale to tell, but let’s also not forget the drive that brought
me here!</p>

<h1>Düsseldorf to Colfosco</h1>
<p>Setting out on 27/06/2020 I ventured to make my final human contact with loyal
ex-colleague James Conolly in Munich. After a couple of days enjoying the final
comforts of a pull-out sofa-bed I set off for Italy.</p>
<p>Driving through the Austrian Alps is always fun, and I made sure to make the
most of it by being stingy and taking the toll-free road between Innsbruck and
the Italian border. One of the major benefits of this route is being able to see
the toll road, which at one point is an obscenely high bridge crossing two
local peaks.</p>

<p class="caption">Not the bridge in question, but still cool</p>

<p>Then out of nowhere appeared the Italian border! A further 90 minute drive
through what still looks a lot like Austria brought me to
<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/XFTx9KSsA9vBSe9t6">Colfosco Camping</a> in Alta Badia.</p>

<h1>Alta Badia</h1>
<p>A region among the Dolomites in South Tyrol, Alta Badia is mostly geared up
for the ski season. I pitched up at a largely empty campsite called Colfosco
Camping, I suspect the emptiness owes largely to the ongoing Coronavirus issue.</p>

<p>It is perfectly situated for a number of great hikes, only minutes from the
foot of 3 different peaks. Given my slightly questionable fitness levels today
I decided tackle the less mountainous area next to Corvara. I forgot to start
Strava but I did manage to draw the approximate route below.</p>

<p>Although still challenging, the whole route was a well-maintained series of
footpaths going from peak to peak in the area.</p>

<p class="caption">A great area for shots of the actual mountains</p>

<p>And of course no scenic trip would be complete without disturbing the peace by
flying my drone around. The wind at the top made it challenging to fly, but on
the way down I managed to find a <a href="">very picturesque viewing spot</a> from which
to fly.</p>

<h1>Alta Badia to Canazei</h1>
<p>On the second day of camping the weather started great and I decided to do a
short hike up to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/5RP97jUhdsnGHdsv9">Cherz</a>.</p>

<p>I found a
really nice hill with a panoramic view of numerous mountains around, and of
course I managed a drone selfie.</p>

<p>As I stood on the hill I heard thunder ring out, at which point it was clear I
needed to get to some shelter quite quickly. I ran back down to the refuge and
sat for about 30 minutes enjoying quite an intense thunderstorm.</p>
<p>At this point it was clear to me I didn’t want to spend another night camping
in stormy weather only to drive to Verona the next day, so I quickly booked
a room at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/UZThqPyfYg7xFrUXA">a nice place in Canazei</a>.</p>
<p>This was by far the best choice I could have made as the drive there was
stunning. I drove out of Colfosco up the mountain and encountered mountain after
mountain and incredible panoramic views. Finally when I hit the top of one pass
I decided it was time to walk up to another peak and take more footage. Although
I was scared of losing my drone to high wind, hopefully you’ll agree the brief
video I did manage to get was quite beautiful.</p>

<h1>What’s Next?</h1>
<p>Tomorrow I will drive to Verona after making a quick stop at Lake Garda. I’ll
be staying at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/dudMDguffZ5CURLY8">The Hostello</a> and checking
out the city for 2 days.</p>
