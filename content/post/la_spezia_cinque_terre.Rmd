I don't exactly recall what drew me towards La Spezia and the surrounding area
when planning the trip, but I received a lot of positive reviews about the area
from those that had preivously visited. I was told lovely tales of hikes
between the five villages (the five lands, Cinque Terre) and the beautiful
coastline, and yet somehow the reality was much better.

Between the 8th and 12th of July I was staying exclusively in a hostel in La
Spezia. The hostel itself and the town were great and very lively, and I even
got the chance to visit a local brewery with a concise range of creative beers.
But the real highlight has to be Cinque Terre, a very brief train ride away
from La Spezia. If you don't make it all the way through reading this post then
I encourage you to at least read the Cinque Terre section!

# La Spezia

[La Spezia](https://goo.gl/maps/qUWUdFxNNZmNMnQt9) is a coastal town in the
region of Liguria. When I arrived in the city by car I was first greeted by
the commercial port with large ships and cranes which didn't seem so appealing.
The reality is after passing that port the town itself has a very modern marina
and a city with many bars and restaurants and an atmosphere to match.

The first stop was the hostel,
[Cinque Terre Backpackers City Hostel](https://goo.gl/maps/jd1PK22v2j5Rp7aE9).
This hostel is really unique compared to many I've stayed in. It has an onsite
bar with dedicated bar staff and a comfortable seating area exclusively for
hostel guests. The owners and staff are, like many Italians seem to be, very
hospitable and incredibly knowledgable about the surrounding area. Whether you
wanted to go on a hike, to the beach, or just for some food, they knew exactly
where you should go!

This is also the first hostel I've stayed at during this trip where the
atmosphere feels almost as it should in normal times. A mixed group of us:
Danes, Dutch, French, Swiss, Italian, and myself, spent a lot of time together
and even went out drinking in these unusual times. The lack of indoor bars and
music meant that we were playing music on the street in the early hours of the
morning.

I can't mention drinking in La Spezia without giving some much-deserved
credit to one of the local breweries, 
[Birrificio del Golfo](https://www.birrificiodelgolfo.com/). This brewery brews
a wide range of beers including a summer ale, an IPA, and even an oyster stout!
Most of their beers were available at the hostel, again a real luxury to have
good craft beer on tap at a hostel!

In my curiosity I asked about the brewery and they got in touch with one of the
owners at the brewery to see if I was able to take a look around. One short
phone call later and I was off for an 11am brewery tour! The brewery is a
modest-sized warehouse but has a lovely bar at the front. I am told in normal
times they have many small events there with food and music, for which I will
undoubtably return in the future.

In the end I left the brewery with 9 beers to take with me, which hopefully
will make it back to Germany intact all the way through Greece!

# Cinque Terre

This area of the coast is just great. There are 5 villages that run along the
coast, the start and end of which are Riomaggiore and Monterosso. They are set
into a fairly steep hillside which is almost entirely covered with vineyards
and all end at the sea.

</center>

The villages themselves are characterised by pastel-coloured buildings and
narrow roads that lead down to the sea. They are all connected both by a series
of hiking trails and also a surprisingly direct trainline.

</center>

I decided I was going to try and hike as much of the route as I could, so from
La Spezia central train station I bought a 16 euro
[Cinque Terre Card](https://www.cinqueterre.eu.com/en/cinque-terre-card) which
entitled me to unlimited train travel for the day as well as access to the
paid hiking routes. There are currently two paid open routes, one between
Corniglia and Vernazza, and other between Vernazza and Monterosso, each costing
7.50 euros. Strangely a single train fare for anywhere on the route costs 4
euros so a nice tip is just always by the longest route in the direction you're
going just in case.

My hike started at Riomaggiore only one stop from La Spezia, or so I thought.
The route between Riomaggiore and Manarola, also known as
[Via dell'Amore](https://www.cinqueterre.eu.com/en/cinque-terre-via-dell-amore)
was unfortunately closed. Instead of taking a much more intense route to start
the hike I decided to hop back on the train and start at Manarola.

</center>

The first section from Manarola is probably the toughest passing through a
village called Volastra which is uphill from the coast. From there I descended
through vineyards, and to my surprise even passed a little stall selling the
local wine on what I would describe as a very narrow hillside section of the
trail.

After a brief visit at Corniglia and focaccia for lunch I got back onto the
trail for the paid section between Corniglia and Vernazza. This was a longer
section but also not overly challenging. The views out into the sea and amongst
the villages was of course beautiful.

</center>

Upon reaching Vernazza I was so warm that I immediately headed for the sea to
cool down, and it felt great. At this point it was getting a little late and
I decided I'd done enough for the day and avoided the final section between
Vernazza and Monterosso. You can see my final route below.

</center>

The next day I felt it would be nice to at least see Monterosso and get some
swimming and snorkelling done, and so I jumped on the train for one last visit
to Cinque Terre. I stopped briefly for some snorkelling at Riomaggiore where
there were a few fish to see, before heading on to the more recognisable beaches
of Monterosso.

Unfortunately most of the beaches at Monterosso required a reservation. I was
reassured back at the hostel that this was COVID related but I had observed
that a couple of the beaches did also require payment which was a little
disappointing. Nevertheless I did find a free and relatively quiet beach
[just up the coast](https://goo.gl/maps/BZVHZphkvDAudZzg7). I enjoyed some
swimming and relaxing on the beach before saying goodbye to Cinque Terre for
this trip.

# A word to cuisine

It's a little curious that I've been writing about my trip through Italy for a
full 2 weeks now and haven't really spoken about food. My diet has been
dominated by the availability of great pizza (amongst other great dishes of
course) and I will pick out two pizza highlights from La Spezia.

The first was simply a very tasty pizza Napoletana from
[Pizza Gourmet](https://goo.gl/maps/W5cy595uVP4SLCBA8), a worryingly touristy
sounding name. Thankfully it was not too touristy but the pizza was great, the
pine nuts and the quality of the olive oil made it particularly tasty.

The second is more of an interesting story around the establishment.
[La Pia Centenaria](https://g.page/LaPiaCentenaria?share) has a history going
back to 1887 starting with Mrs. Pia who made farinata, a sort of savoury
pancake made from chickpea flour, as well as a sweet chestnut version, for the
poorer people of the town. The sit-down restaurant opened in 1998 and following
the tradition you can get pizza and farinata together for less than 4 euros.

I wouldn't say the pizza tastes particularly special but, given that they have
stuck to their roots in feeding people without much money, I am more than happy
with my dining experience there!

After a day of total relaxation in La Spezia I got back on the road for my next
stop, Firenze!
