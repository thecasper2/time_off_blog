I am in two minds about writing this as a single post; a visit the site of the
ancient Olympic games over 2500 years ago, and a truly incredible hike between
two villages in the Peloponnese mountains. To think that everything I have seen
on this trip to Greece is in one region of the mainland is incredible.

I beg of you to take the time to at least glance at both sections of this post.
As someone not well versed in history I was overwhelmed by the site of the
ancient Olympic games, and as a fairly amateur hiker I was amazed by the
beauty and natural diversity of the hike between the mountainous villages
of Stemnitsa and Dimitsana. I am certain that either one of these sections will
inspire you to one day take a trip to the Peloponnese region of mainland Greece. 

# Archaia Olympia

The main town of Archaia Olympia is fairly touristy, but by no means in an
unpleasant way. There are shops with postcards and fridge magnets, and even a
pizza restaurant. But they also have something that makes this town historically
incredible, the archaeological ruins of the site of the original Olympic games
from over 2500 years ago.

In this post I can't possibly give a full account of what went on at the
Olympic games, the history is just so detailed and spans nearly 1200 years of
games! The best I can hope to do is give a flavour of the original games and
encourage you to embark on a journey to visit this town and take in its history.

There are actually three sites to visit in the area and all are covered under
one â‚¬12 ticket. They are:

- [The Museum of the History of the Olympic Games of antiquity](https://goo.gl/maps/pLKUShMfcqbtJ6fL6)
- [The Archaeological Site of Olympia](https://goo.gl/maps/gSfv2fpX4K2mGivV6) (the physical archaeological remains)
- [Archaeological Museum of Olympia](https://goo.gl/maps/BEjHRsFzAbv9Dcd86)

My first stop was the museum of the history of the games, and this is the ideal
place to start as it really helps to understand what went on at the games
before seeing the physical site.

</center>

There are hundreds of, figurines, bronze works, statues, and stone works that
were retrieved from the site and given the age of these items it is incredible
just how well-preserved everything is. I could not believe I was looking at
items in some cases made over 2500 years ago. The information available at the
museum is also extensive.

</center>

The games lasted an incredible 1169 years before finally being abolished in
393 AD by Roman Emperor Theodosius I. The athletes needed to be Greek, and
born a free citizens to parents who were also free citizens. The games could be
attended by almost everyone, barbarians, slaves, rich, poor, but women were
forbidden from attending the games. One notable exception was made:
[Kallipateira](http://ancientolympics.arts.kuleuven.be/sourceEN/D105EN.html),
daughter of Olympic champion Diagoras secretly went to see the games to see her
son Peisirodos compete in the boxing. Out of respect for the athletic history
of her family she was spared punishment.

After reading all this impressive history I was expecting to only be able to
see such a historic archaeological site from quite a distance. I was therefore
quite surprised to learn that you can walk almost through the remains
themselves!

</center>

You can walk round the entire site comfortably in an hour. The remains of each
building have a really nice description of what the building was and its
function. For me the walkway that leads to the main running track is the most
prominent remaining feature, as it's quite magical to imagine walking down
that tunnel to 40000 people waiting to watch the games.

</center>

And in fact you can do exactly that, walk through that tunnel and you end up
at the main track where people sat over 2000 years ago to watch the games.

</center>

There are remains of many buildings around the site, the Temple of Hera where
the modern Olympic torch is lit, the Temple of Zeus, Octagon (a villa for
Roman emperor Nero), as well as a meeting and socialising point for the
athletes.

</center>

Finally after walking through the archaeological remains I headed to
[the Archaeological Museum of Olympia](https://goo.gl/maps/BEjHRsFzAbv9Dcd86).
This is the newer of the two museums and contains further artifacts recovered
from the archaeological site. This museum focuses less on the history of the
games, but still includes a large number of interesting figurines and statues.

</center>

My visit to Archaia Olympia all took place on the day I was leaving there, all
in all only around 5 hours. I then took of in the direction of Stemnitsa to
tackle the first section of [the Menalon Trail](https://menalontrail.eu/).

# Stemnitsa & Dimitsana

The journey to [Stemnitsa](https://goo.gl/maps/PT8aihq2wvqMRFrEA) involves a
scenic drive through the mountains with plenty of winding roads. On my arrival
I checked into [Tsarbou Guesthouse](https://goo.gl/maps/6ZR4pKzA38CsPU3B8).
The guesthouse is lovely, comfortable and, as is the case with most Greek
establishments, run by a lovely lady called Christina who couldn't do enough to
help me. Her breakfasts were especially fantastic, and used ingredients from
her and her husband's farm.

A 5 minute walk through the town up through a small path gets you to
[Stemnitsa Castle](https://goo.gl/maps/Z9xy4c8T3Mrx282W9) which has a great
view over the mountains as well as the village of Stemnitsa itself.

</center>

After a fairly relaxed evening I woke up the next day ready to tackle the first
section of [The Menalon Trail](https://menalontrail.eu/). The whole trail
consists of 8 sections and 75km. The first section is the 3rd longest at 12.5km
and takes you down a long descent into the valley before emerging up to the
village of Dimitsana. Somehow due to small deviations and probably some GPS
noise I managed to get 16.5km recorded on Strava for my hike.

</center>

The trail starts from the bell tower at Stemnitsa and immediately it is clear
that there is quite a descent.

<center>

</center>

It took around 2 hours in total to descend into the valley. The route is
very well signposted, and at regular intervals there are orange dots painted on
rocks to ensure you are still on the trail. I am notorious for losing a trail
and even I found it quite easy to follow this one.

<center>
![Me as I descend into the valley](/post/archaia_olympia_stemnitsa_dimitsana_files/IMG_20200725_111500_1.jpg){width=50% height=50%}

</center>

At some point during the descent I reached a little monastery known as
"The transformation of God" (when translated from Greek). Although the building
isn't so special in itself, the view from the platform is quite daunting. From
the platform you can see quite a drop down to the valley below, the floor of
which is obscured by trees.

<center>

</center>

Continuing further down I eventually reached the lowest point of elevation on
my hike when crossing a bridge over the river. It was almost teasing as there
is an impressive waterfall with some beautiful blue water pooling below, but
absolutely no way to reach it. It would have been a much welcomed refreshing
swim.

<center>

</center>

The trail then continues for quite a long time uphill, passing through a mixture
of woods, gravel paths, and sections of road. Early on in the uphill is another
monastery, this is an excellent place to take on water if needed. It's also a
great place to meet a lot of cats!

<center>
![The many cats of [Moni Panagias Filosofou](https://goo.gl/maps/eqShLXa93PnG69jq9)](/post/archaia_olympia_stemnitsa_dimitsana_files/IMG_20200725_124700_1.jpg){width=50% height=50%}

</center>

Another small treat on the uphill is a stream of water that runs down the
stairs leading upwards. It's almost impossible to not get your feet wet so I
took the time to just sit down and cool off with the water follow over my feet.

</center>

After yet more uphill the end was in sight. Just before reaching
[Dimitsana](https://goo.gl/maps/rQ8zbotqWTnor8Lt9) the route took me past the
[Open air water power museum](https://goo.gl/maps/FechhvEEFBN8HwQr7), a small
museum that shows the historic use of water power in the area including for
making gunpowder.

After a rather tired museum visit I push on for the end, but not before
spotting an unused football pitch. I took a seat in the dugout and sent my drone
to inspect Dimitsana, the end of the trail!

</center>

Upon reaching the village I bought a drink, sat down, and then took a taxi back
to Stemnitsa. 5 hours of hiking was undone by 10 minutes of driving, but I was
delighted to be back to a comfortable bed and a nice shower.
