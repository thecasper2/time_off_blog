Today I embarked on the mission of brewing ginger beer!

This escapade came about mostly by chance. I say chance but actually I am fully
aware of the power modern-day recommender systems much like YouTube uses. I was
kindly introduced by YouTube to the following
[recipe for brewing ginger beer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpgSS7moEzI).

I will update this project post with the latest developments in my ginger
brewing process. There will be no publication bias, if it fails I will still
show my failure. If the resulting mixture kills me, then I will ensure someone
updates it with a warning about not following my process.

# The Ginger Bug

The first step is creating the "ginger bug": a mixture of ginger, sugar and
water designed to stimulate the growth of the yeast that naturally occurs on
root ginger.

This process is quite similar to the one I use to create a sourdough yeast for
pizza. That one is simply a mixture of flour and water, apparently the
carbohydrates in flour are sufficient food for the yeast that also lives inside
the flour.

More to follow later!
