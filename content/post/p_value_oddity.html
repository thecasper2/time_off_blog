<p>Most people that have had the misfortune of even gently stepping into the world
of statistics will have come across p-values. Some may be brave enough to assert
that it tells as about the probability of observing data if the null hypothesis
is true, but what does it tell us about the alternative hypothesis?</p>
<p>I want to tell a tale of a statistical oddity that I came across on the coursera
statistics course I am taking. I’ll try to keep the incidental points simple
without saying anything that is mathematically wrong, my only goal is to make
you feel more unsettled about statistics much like I feel.</p>
<div id="high-power-tests" class="section level1">
<h1>High Power Tests</h1>
<p>Practical examples always help me so I’ll lay out a nice hypothetical example.
Let’s say you run a nice little website selling different cheeses (the product
is irrelevant, I just like cheese). You can measure the average basket value,
namely how much people spend on a single transaction on cheese on your website
on average. On your current website the average basket value is £60, that’s
right people really love cheese.</p>
<p>Imagine you come up with a new website design that you suspect will increase
the average basket value. I have the gift of foresight and I can crytpically
tell you that this change will have one of two effects:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The average value will increase to £61</li>
<li>The average value will stay at £60</li>
</ol>
<p>Through a standard A/B test you decide to show 4000 people the old website and
another 4000 people the new website. This is a large sample, if case one is true
then this is a high powered test, the statistical power here is over 99%. If
this true effect exists then you are very likely to find it!</p>
<p>You as a frequent A/B tester know p-values, you always consider values &lt; 0.05
as statistically significant and expect to make false positives 95% of the time.
You run your test and observe a p-value of 0.025, quite significant you might
say! The probabiltiy of observing your test data under the null hypothesis is
very low, but is that enough to reject it?</p>
<p>To illustrate the oddity let’s do some simulations. Let’s run the test 20000
times, 10000 times when we know case 1) is true, and 10000 times when case 2) is
true. We’ll use a two-tailed t-test, i.e. testing that the mean basket value for
our new website is different (more or less) than our original website.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(23)
# Each sample group should have 4000 participants
n &lt;- 4000
# The old website has a mean basket value of £60
mu_original &lt;- 60
# Case 1) The new website has a mean basket value of £60
mu_case1 &lt;- 60
# Case 2) The new website has a mean basket value of £61
mu_case2 &lt;- 61
# Let&#39;s assume the average basket value has a standard deviation of 10 in any
# case
sd &lt;- 10

# We run both simulations 10000 times and record the p-values for each
sims &lt;- 10000
p_vals_effect &lt;- numeric(sims)
p_vals_no_effect &lt;- numeric(sims)

for(i in 1:sims){
    # We draw 4000 random samples from each of the 3 situations
    x1 &lt;- rnorm(n = n, mean = mu_original, sd = sd)
    x2 &lt;- rnorm(n = n, mean = mu_case1, sd = sd)
    y &lt;- rnorm(n = n, mean = mu_case2, sd = sd)
    # We observe the p-values of a t-test in both cases:
    # 1) Old vs case 1)
    # 2) Old vs case 2)
    p_vals_effect[i] &lt;- t.test(x1, y)$p.value
    p_vals_no_effect[i] &lt;- t.test(x1, x2)$p.value
}

p_vals &lt;- data.table(
    rownum = 1:sims,
    &quot;Effect&quot; = p_vals_effect,
    &quot;No effect&quot; = p_vals_no_effect
)
plot_p_vals &lt;- melt(p_vals, id=&quot;rownum&quot;)
plot_p_vals[, variable := factor(variable, levels=c(&quot;No effect&quot;, &quot;Effect&quot;))]

g &lt;- ggplot(plot_p_vals, aes(x=value, fill=variable))  +
    theme_bw() +
    labs(
        x=&quot;p-values&quot;, y=&quot;Frequency&quot;, fill=&quot;&quot;,
        title=&quot;Observed p-values for 2 cases:&quot;,
        subtitle=paste0(
            &quot;1) No true difference between samples&quot;,
            &quot;\n2) True mean differs by £1&quot;
        )
    )
g + geom_histogram(boundary=0, binwidth = 0.05, position=&quot;identity&quot;) +
    facet_wrap(~variable, scales = &quot;free_y&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/p_value_oddity_files/figure-html/sims-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>On the face of it things look great: when there is no effect every p-value is
just as likely. This is right because 5% of the time when there is no effect
we will see a p-value &lt; 0.05, this is a false positive and we expect it 5% of
the time. On the contrary when there is a effect the p-values are almost always
really small, so much so we had to rescale the y-axis. We’ll be rejecting the
null hypothesis a lot of the time!</p>
<p>But this wasn’t the question. I said in your single test you saw a p-value of
0.025, below your usual p-value threshold of 0.05 for rejecting the null. Let’s
zoom in on our chart and keep the scales the same.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>g + xlim(0.009, 0.05) + geom_histogram(
    boundary=0, binwidth = 0.01, position=&quot;dodge&quot;
) + facet_wrap(~variable) +
    geom_vline(xintercept=0.02, linetype=&quot;dashed&quot;)+
    geom_vline(xintercept=0.03, linetype=&quot;dashed&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/p_value_oddity_files/figure-html/chart_zoom-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>When we look at p-values between 0.02 and 0.03 we see them roughly
<strong>1.05%</strong>
of the
time when there is no effect, but only
<strong>0.5%</strong>
of the time when there is an effect! This is because the statistical power is
so strong that very small p-values are much more likely when there is an effect
(at least for our specific effect of £1 increase). The true sensible conclusion
here after seeing a p-value of 0.025 is that we are more likely living in the
reality that our new website doesn’t increase the cheese sales, rather than
adding an extra £1 to each basket value.</p>
</div>
<div id="conclusion" class="section level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>The general conclusion here is that the higher the statistical power the more
likely we are to observe even smaller p-values. At some critical point p-values
we used to treat as significant (in our case 0.025) suddenly give more evidence
that the null hypothesis is generating our data rather than some alternative.</p>
<p>This is as much as I have read on the subject, my aim was only to make you
think and worry because that is the ultimate goal of statistics. I welcome
any critical feedback or review in the comments below on what I’ve written,
and equally I would love to hear of any practical situations where this has been
corrected for.</p>
