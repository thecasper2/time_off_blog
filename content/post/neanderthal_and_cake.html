<p>Today Thomas and I embarked on a cycling adventure to the Neanderthal museum.
I rounded it off by making some lemon drizzle cake (there is a video!) and
then making vegetarian Swedish meatballs for dinner.</p>
<p>For those of you who are desperately waiting for some hardcore statistics as I
promised in the introduction post then I can only apologise. Tomorrow I’m back
on the studying so I suspect you’ll be treated to the pitfalls of interpreting
effect sizes in a day or two.</p>

<h1>Neanderthal</h1>
<p>27 degrees is starting to become a fairly normal spring day in Düsseldorf I
have noticed in recent years, but it does make cycling a bit more interesting.

to the Neanderthal museum.</p>

<p>My bike isn’t doing so well at the moment as one of the gear shifters snapped
off. I can only gear down which was ideal for the uphills, but somewhat
frustrating for the numerous downhills. Nevertheless we chilled out outside the
museum and

<h1>Lemon Drizzle Cake</h1>
<p>There was a bonus in the meal planning this week: lemon drizzle cake. I was
following

I found online and the results were fairly pleasing. If you want to see me
making it, look no further:</p>

<h1>Vegetarian Swedish Meatballs</h1>
<p>And finally, in this somewhat eventful day, I made vegetarian Swedish
meatballs for dinner. The sauce is a bit questionable, maybe because I used a
low-quality stock, but overall I’m still quite happy with the dish. For those
interested
