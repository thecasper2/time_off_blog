<p>The lack of posts in recent days is mostly due to extensive trip preparations
in advance of a departure on Saturday, but with most of those complete I can
share my exciting plans!</p>
<div id="a-new-drone" class="section level1">
<h1>A New Drone</h1>
<p>Naturally this is one of the most exciting parts for me. My other drone, the
Parrot Disco, is very large, hard to transport, and requires a lot of space for
takeoff. Definitely not ideal for capturing footage of wooded areas, beaches,
and places not so accessible by car. After a short amount of research the
obvious travel drone is the DJI Mavic Mini.</p>

<p>With 3 batteries serving approximately 20 minutes of flight-time each, the
possibility to charge via USB in the car, all coming inside a 28x19x8cm carry
case, it’s a clear winner. I tested it out on the bank of the Rhein in
Düsseldorf, check out the video below.</p>

<div id="the-first-few-stops" class="section level1">
<h1>The First Few Stops</h1>
<p>In the previous post I embedded my route through Italy and Greece, so if you’re
interested in the full route I encourage you to take a look. I just wanted to
focus on the first 3 stops en route.</p>
<div id="munich" class="section level2">
<h2>Munich</h2>
<p>The lesser-visited city in all road trips of Italy, the southern-German city
of Munich is my first stop. This is purely to break up the first big drive,
pay a visit to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/conolly/">James Conolly</a>. I don’t
suppose my visit will be particularly cultural, instead likely focusing on
(as he would call it) achieving an advanced state of refreshment.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-dolomites" class="section level2">
<h2>The Dolomites</h2>
<p>The first Italian stop is
<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/DjcnjwC8PskhyhKr6">this campsite in the Dolomites</a>. The
area is littered with winter ski slopes which I’m hoping delivers some really
nice panoramic views and walking trails in the summer. I was also recommended
the nearby town of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urtij%C3%ABi">Ortisei/Urtijëi</a> which has
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Urtijei.ogg">a rather bizarre pronounciation</a>.</p>
<p>It’s also a great opportunity to test out the viability of my tent in warm
weather!</p>

<p>After leaving I’ll have a quick chance to visit the highly-rated
<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/u5TyY4fkvi5XU9Yc9">Lake Garda</a>. Aside from being quite
beautiful there appears to be a number of places to swim, ideal for the
underwater GoPro footage!</p>
</div>
<div id="verona" class="section level2">
<h2>Verona</h2>
<p>After approximately 3 years I make my return to hostelling with a stay at
<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/THuhFPw1X7vWFCPF9">The Hostello in Verona</a>. During my
2-night stay in the city there are a number of obvious highlights. The obvious
highlight is <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/cCxgekaoxdkFrQdG9">The Verona Arena</a>, a well
preserved Roman amphitheater. Verona is also the setting for Shakespeare’s Romeo
&amp; Juliet, a significant number of tourists flock to Juliet’s house.</p>
<p>I have read that 1 day is probably enough to see the sights, but it can’t hurt
to relax and potentially eat beyond my comfort level.</p>

<div id="the-rest" class="section level1">
<h1>The Rest</h1>
<p>As I said in the previous post I’m going to keep this blog awash with posts
from the trip. Drone footage, Underwater GoPro footage, tales, photos, history,
I will do my very best to document how the trip goes!</p>
