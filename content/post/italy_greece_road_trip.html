<p>Despite the Coronavirus situation, crisis, event, or whichever doomsday
terminology is currently most appropriate, a handful of countries are reopening
their borders cautiously for tourism and unfortunately for them as they lift
these restrictions they are likely to see my face at the door.</p>
<p>There are of course moral implications to travelling at this time and it’s very
easy to engage in cognitive dissonance to justify not missing out on travel a
mere three months after widespread lockdown measures. Nevertheless after
speaking to some Italian and Greek friends of mine I have concluded that I can
minimise my risk to the rest of society. I’m going to embark on a road trip
through Italy and Greece and enjoy the remoteness of some of their
lesser-touristy areas.</p>
<p>Below you can see the latest draft of my intended route. It is slowly being
improved with tips from some very kind friends of mine from the areas. If all
goes well then at the end of June I will embark on this mission!</p>

<p>My aim is to dedicate a section of this blog to that travel. With some unique
insights from friends I will do my very best to show off what the two countries
have to offer, and as I’ll be travelling by car I hope to get some beautiful
drone footage along the way.</p>
