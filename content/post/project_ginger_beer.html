<p>Today I embarked on the mission of brewing ginger beer!</p>
<p>This escapade came about mostly by chance. I say chance but actually I am fully
aware of the power modern-day recommender systems much like YouTube uses. I was
kindly introduced by YouTube to the following
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpgSS7moEzI">recipe for brewing ginger beer</a>.</p>
<p>I will update this project post with the latest developments in my ginger
brewing process. There will be no publication bias, if it fails I will still
show my failure. If the resulting mixture kills me, then I will ensure someone
updates it with a warning about not following my process.</p>

<h1>The Ginger Bug</h1>
<p>The first step is creating the “ginger bug”: a mixture of ginger, sugar and
water designed to stimulate the growth of the yeast that naturally occurs on
root ginger.</p>

<p>This process is quite similar to the one I use to create a sourdough yeast for
pizza. That one is simply a mixture of flour and water, apparently the
carbohydrates in flour are sufficient food for the yeast that also lives inside
the flour.</p>

<div id="bottling-time" class="section level1">
<h1>Bottling Time</h1>
<p>After creating the ginger bug apparently it was time to bottle after about 2-3
days. I got a bit sidetracked (I also didn’t buy lemons in time…) and so
bottling came approximately 5 days after starting the bug. Hopefully it’s
something that gets better with age.</p>
<p>The next step was to boil up a large amount of water, ginger and sugar in a pot
for 10 minutes, and then let it cool. After it cooled I added some (maybe half)
of the ginger bug into the mixture and the juice of a lemon.</p>
<p>When I was making the large mixture I actually blended ginger, so I was left
with a ginger paste which wouldn’t remove the ginger if I used a sieve. Thanks
to my creative thinking I used a Vietnamse coffee filter which was perfect!
I placed it in some large bottles and poured the mixture through. It removed
lots of the fine ginger but left enough sediment through to make the mixture
look authentic somehow.</p>

<p>This morning concluded the first overnight session of the bottled ginger. It
should be fermenting away and producing alcohol and carbon dioxide. The real
test was to “burp” the beer. I quickly opened the bottles and to my satisfaction
a loud pop ensued! This is a great sign that fermentation is underway. I will
leave this process going maybe for around 4-6 days, burping daily, then will
move them to the fridge.</p>

<h1>The Final Product</h1>
<p>After some high-pressure situations I finally got to drink the end product. The
carbonation was extreme, if you don’t burp the bottle daily I think it’s fair
to say you have a grenade sitting in your kitchen. The taste was great, it was
very sweet due to all the sugar but you could tell there was an alcoholic
aspect. It doesn’t feel very strong (maybe 2-3% from extensive alcohol-drinking
experience) but that isn’t a problem, I brewed 8 litres after all.</p>

<p>All-in-all I can highly recommend brewing ginger beer from home. It’s very easy
and rewarding.</p>
