<p>I am writing from the early stages of my 23 hour ferry journey between Ancona
:it: and Patras :greece:. Just before setting off I had time to visit Perugia
and stay at a B&amp;B on a farm. It was intended as a stop-off but transpiring to
be one of my favourite Italian cities!</p>
<p>Perugia for me was a little hidden treasure: a city atop a hill with fortress
walls and narrow maze-like streets within, not to mention a panoramic view
across the surrounding landscape.</p>
<p>Finally I departed for my final Italian stop: Ancona. A deceptive glimpse of
the turquoise-blue Adriatic sea is a little let down by a fairly unremarkable
port city, but thankfully I had a day to explore the surrounding area and there
was some beautiful coastline to be found. A welcome view before a daunting
23 hour trip across the Adriatic sea with no accommodation…</p>

<h1>Perugia</h1>
<p>The drive from Lake Trasimeno to my accommodation in Perugia only lasted
approximately 30 minutes. This time I was booked into a dorm room at the
fascinating <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/CPvhFYBgP7qc8nzL9">Perugia Farmhouse B&amp;B</a>.
About a 10 minute drive outside Perugia, the farmhouse naturally has a large
amount of open space for guests as well as a very nice pool. But the real
icing on my cake was an inbound birthday party the next day which meant I was
upgraded to my own private little cabin on the farmland!</p>

<p>The room was very cosy and the ideal place to take a few hours and write my
previous post.</p>

<p>The city of Perugia is set on a hilltop meaning the grounds of the B&amp;B had a
nice view over the city with the comfort of being in an open rural area.</p>

<p>I have thus far made the claim that Perugia was one of my favourite cities in
Italy. If you know me, my reluctance to enjoy purely religious history too much,
and a slight reluctance to visit expensive tourist attractions, you will know
how delighted I was to ascend into the city by escalator into
<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/LgfGjs4E1eCSKEkB9">Rocca Paolina</a>, a fortress fully open
to the public.</p>
<center>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/post/perugia_high_seas_files/IMG_20200718_120840.jpg" style="width:50.0%;height:50.0%" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/LgfGjs4E1eCSKEkB9">Rocca Paolina</a>, a fortress that is free and open to the public</p>
</div>
</center>
<p>The fortress was built in 1540-1543 during the Renaissance and was built from
materials obtained by destroying over a hundred houses, as well as churches and
monasteries, destroying a whole district. Given that it was built as a show of
papal power, and at the cost of buildings even more ancient than itself, I
should find it somewhat appalling, but nevertheless I cannot deny it is an
interesting structure.</p>
<p>When you reach the top of the fortress remains (again by escalator) you are
greeted to one of many panoramic views of the surrounding landscape.</p>

<p class="caption">A view from <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/vFUq9i4Q4RaK16HW7">Giardini Carducci</a> above the fortress</p>
</div>
</center>
<p>But maybe even more interesting for me is taking a journey into the North-east
of the city. The streets here were incredibly quiet, free even of locals walking
around. It was like a maze navigating winding narrow streets with long sets of
steps leading to nowhere except a few front doors. I get the impression that not
much has changed in the city since it was built.</p>

<p>Finally a nice quiet place to take in a view over the North-east is
<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/4CCPR5XYhp61BMik8">Porta Sole</a>. There are some nice benches
under trees to take in a little landscape in peace.</p>

<p>The stop in Perugia was more by necessity due to the route to Ancona, it turned
out to be a worthwhile stop that I would recommend to anyone!</p>
</div>
<div id="ancona" class="section level1">
<h1>Ancona</h1>
<p>Setting off from Perugia I head for my final Italian stop, the port city of
Ancona. The first sign of an imminent arrival is a glimpse of the Adriatic sea.
The city of Ancona itself is not so inspiring, it is clear the city is mostly
geared towards being a port. I took a brief walk around the city to find
something to eat and it was quite pleasant, but also unremarkable.</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/BYSAqeTK1ucGix1e9">Piazza Cavour</a>, the centrepiece of a city I can’t say too much about</p>
</div>
</center>
<p>Thankfully only a 10-15 minute drive outside of the city takes you to some
stunning coastline away from the shipping routes. On a warm Sunday afternoon it
was no surprise to find a lot of locals parked at the top of the hill which
leads down a steep path to
<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/H2xamHmN6dVd9dn89">Mezzavalle Beach</a>.</p>
<center>

<p class="caption">A steep path down to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/H2xamHmN6dVd9dn89">Mezzavalle Beach</a></p>
</div>
</center>
<p>I walked down to the lesser-populated end of the beach to enjoy some swimming.
As the sun began to set it was time to head back to Ancona to prepare for the
next day, a potentially torturous 23-hour ferry trip with nothing other than
a small air mattress.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-sea" class="section level1">
<h1>The sea</h1>
<p><strong>20/07 19:38</strong></p>
<p>I am sitting inside the ship looking out the window at a pitch-black Adriatic
sea. I embarked at 16:30 (a full 3 hours later than my ticket time), taking
as many comforts as I could from my car, before settling down at some seating
upstairs and enjoying the first of presumably many beers to help pass the time.</p>

<p>Watching the sunset seems to be a nice way to send myself to sleep!</p>

<p><strong>21/07 08:22</strong></p>
<p>My apprehension about getting through the night turned out to be unnecessary.
Armed with only an inflatable mattress and the warm sea air out on deck I
managed to get 5 hours of reasonable sleep with even some unusual dreams.
Ultimately I was woken up by the sunrise over the mountains of Albania, and it
was hard to be upset by that.</p>

<p>I took some time to enjoy it before the rest of the ship, comfortably sleeping,
made their appearance.</p>

<p>Then slowly the boat passed between Albania and Corfu, signalling that we were
approaching the first stop, Igoumenitsa.</p>

<p>I still have about 6 more hours until we arrive in Patras but I will leave the
writing for now, you will just have to imagine the views sailing Greek
coastline for now…</p>
