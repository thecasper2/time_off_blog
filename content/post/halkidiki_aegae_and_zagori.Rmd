Knowing my trip is coming to an end, Greece is presenting me its most awesome
sights in a bid to keep me there. The beautiful coastline of Halkidiki, the
unbelievably well-preserved tombs at Aegae, and the natural overwhelming beauty
of Zagori were an unbeatable end to my time in Greece.

The three final stops in Greece comprised of arguably the best examples of each
category of tourism: the coastline of Halkidiki was the most beautiful I've
seen so far, the tombs at Aegae and their contents are the best-preserved and
most stunning of the historical sites I have visited, and Zagori was undoubtedly
the best example of natural beauty in Greece.

# Halkidiki

A popular weekend holiday spot for those living in and around Thessaloniki,
Halkidiki comprises of three peninsulas that extend into the Aegean sea. The
first, strictly an island as it is divided by a man-made canal, is geared more
towards tourism. The second focuses more on natural beauty with a range of
rocky and sandy beaches sometimes accessed from hillsides, although tourism is
still present courtesy of vacation rentals, beach bars, and boat rentals. The
third mostly comprises of Mount Athos, home to a number of monasteries built
upon the mountain, practically only accessible by boat, and rather archaically
only open to visit by men.

After collecting my friends Jake and Nataša from Thessaloniki airport, we headed
for a long weekend stay at the town of
[Vourvourou](https://goo.gl/maps/rVrubcvrbqNBAoHe7) on the second peninsula.
From this base we would explore the whole peninsula as well as the nearby
island of [Diaporos](https://goo.gl/maps/CRDQbnLBNJ6kmb8o9) by boat.

Instead of adding my collection of photos from my phone for this section of
the trip, I will instead just let you enjoy this video created by Nataša that
does Halkidiki, as well as Mount Olympus, all the justice required.

Halkidiki seems to have something for everyone: a peninsula for partying, a
peninsula for natural beauty, and a peninsula with a mountain topped with
monasteries. It is easily accessible from Thessaloniki so there really is
little excuse for the foreign traveller not to discover and explore Halkidiki.

# The Royal Tombs of Aegae

After driving West back past Thessaloniki one may be forgiven for dismissing
the small village of [Vergina](https://goo.gl/maps/dm1u1m4D5XdYynR4A). What
actually lies here is not only spectacular but of great significance to the
spread of Hellenic culture around the world. This is where Philip II, father of
Alexander the Great, transformed the Macedonian empire into one of the world's
greatest influential powers. His well-preserved remains were discovered here in
one of the four almost untouched tombs.

Visitors to the tombs enter the archaeological site and are greeted by a small
grassy mound which seems of little importance. A small tunnel that takes you
underneath the mound suddenly reveals a much larger underground space that
plays host to some quite incredible archaeological remains.

The museum under the mound is kept very dark but contains a number of exhibits
discovered at the tombs. These range from burial pots and armour to the
incredible golden larnax in which Philip II was buried, so well preserved it is
hard to believe it wasn't made recently.

There are two staircases in the museum each leading down to the entrance of
a overwhelming tomb. The first belongs to Philip II, and the second is believed
to belong to the young son of Alexander the Great and Roxane.

The village of Vergina is slightly awkwardly located, it isn't along many
touristic routes and almost certainly requires a car to access. But if you
have the luxury of being able to visit, possibly when going between
[Meteora](https://goo.gl/maps/CfuBY28QniriYK1A8) and the north of the mainland,
then I can highly recommend stopping at this amazing museum.

# Zagori

[Zagorohoria](https://goo.gl/maps/kiyG2Fx2FjCn4pwb8), translated as the villages
of Zagori, were my last stop on my trip throughout Greece. The area is quite a
contrast to the rest of Greece with cooler weather, much greener scenery, and
unparalleled views from gorges and steep cliffs.

My accommodation for the last part of my trip was
[Rokka Guesthouse](https://goo.gl/maps/ZmmDEN9W1YjjyzcG9) which had a sweeping
panoramic view over the landscape as so many guesthouses seem to have in
Greece. The guesthouse focuses on providing some incredibly tasty food sourced
entirely from the region. It is by far some of the best food I have tasted in
Greece!

Despite only one full day here I managed to undertake two great hikes. I started
with the shorter of the two which began at
[Kokkorou bridge](https://goo.gl/maps/78w3m8n9zNcisr1C7) and leads up the gorge.
It follows the river, which is dry in summer, and as such is quite easy.
Looking up at the gorge gives a good appetite to see it from a more spectacular
angle.

After this short hike I jumped back into the car and headed for the start of the
[Vradeto Steps](https://goo.gl/maps/6Ftarw7p7Lz2ojjq9). These steps, set into
the side of a cliff, were built 200 years ago and until 1973 were the only means
of reaching Vradeto.

Upon arriving at the [starting point](https://goo.gl/maps/8WB9DqP1W6GSaqvo6) for
climbing the steps it is not incredibly clear how to reach them as they lie on
the other side of a gorge. However just following the path takes you over a
small bridge to the base of the steps. Just before that I took the chance to
explore the steps and the area by drone.

I then embarked on my mission to climb the stairs.

1200 steps later and you find yourself at the top and on the way to the village
of Vradeto. Through lack of planning I thought I had achieved my goal for the
day and took some lunch in Vradeto. Only there I was told about
[Beloi viewpoint](https://goo.gl/maps/vtuaotjtWBRGpNNn9), a short walk from the
village.

</center>

In the end I decided to take the walk and I am eternally grateful that
I did so. I reached the viewpoint, my final yet most spectacular view in Greece
by far looking down the [Vikos Gorge](https://goo.gl/maps/THU7x4WYahYHbhK9A).

It is hard to describe the placement of the viewpoint set into a cliff, but
hopefully the following video gives you an appreciation for the height as well
as the view you get.

The view stretches for kilometers down the gorge and the viewpoint itself is at
the edge of a very steep cliff. It seems that the sun sets behind the left side
of the gorge, but unfortunately I was unable to stay and find out.

I sat there for a very long time taking in the view until eventually some
ominous clouds and the sound of thunder encouraged me to head back to my car.
It was the perfect final stop in Greece, and the next day I would head to the
port of [Igoumenitsa](https://goo.gl/maps/ND44RH6jUaeq3NTA7) to sail back to
Italy.
