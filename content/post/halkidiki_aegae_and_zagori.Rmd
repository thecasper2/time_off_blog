Knowing my trip is coming to an end, Greece is presenting me its most awesome
sights in a bid to keep me there. The beautiful coastline of Halkidiki, the
unbelievably well-preserved tombs at Aegae, and the natural overwhelming beauty
of Zagori were an unbeatable end to my time in Greece.

The three final stops in Greece comprised of arguably the best examples of each
category of tourism: the coastline of Halkidiki was the most beautiful I've
seen so far, the tombs at Aegae and their contents are the best-preserved and
most stunning of the historical sites I have visited, and Zagori was undoutably
the best example of natural beauty in Greece.

# Halkidiki

A popular weekend holiday spot for those living in and around Thessaloniki,
Halkidiki comprises of three peninsulas that extend into the Aegean sea. The
first, strictly an island as it is divided by a man-made canal, is geared more
towards tourism. The second focuses more on natural beauty with a range of
rocky and sandy beaches sometimes accessed from hillsides, although tourism is
still present courtesy of vacation rentals, beach bars, and boat rentals. The
third mostly comprises of Mount Athos, home to a number of monasteries built
upon the mountain, practically only accessible by boat, and rather archaically
only visitable by men.

After collecting my friends Jake and Nataša from Thessaloniki airport, we headed
for a long weekend stay at the town of [Vourvourou]() on the second peninsula.
From this base we would explore the whole peninsula as well as the nearby
island of [Diaporos]() by boat.

# The Royal Tombs of Aegae

After driving West back past Thessaloniki one may be forgiven for dismissing
the small village of [Vergina](). What actually lies here is not only
spectacular but of great significance to the spread of Hellenic culture around
the world. This is where Philip II, father of Alexander the Great, transformed
the Macedonian empire into one of the world's greatest influential powers. His
well-preserved remains were discovered here in one of the four almost untouched
tombs.

Visitors to the tombs enter the archeological site and are greeted by a small
grassy mound which seems of little importance. A small tunnel that takes you
underneath the mound suddenly reveals a much larger underground space that
plays host to some quite incredible archeological remains.

The museum under the mound is kept very dark but contains a number of exhibits
discovered at the tombs. These range from burial pots and armour to the
incredible golden ??? in which Philip II was buried, so well preserved it is
hard to believe it wasn't made recently.

There are two staircases in the museum each leading down to the entrance of
a overwhelming tomb. The first belongs to Philip II, and the second is believed
to belong to the young son of Alexander the Great and Roxane.
