It has been two weeks of break and I am about ready to start writing!

The two weeks have been simultaneously relaxing and eventful. After 8 years of
full-time working I haven't been in a hurry to be extremely productive too fast,
but have focused mostly on a couple of hobbies and a bit of online learning.

In this first post I wanted to give an introduction to these activities as
some of you may not be familiar with all of them. I am aware that just talking
about each of them may not be very engaging, so I will try and generate some
nice content that hopefully makes you want to come back for the next post!

Before I get started on the activities I want to say thank you for at least
taking the time to read this. In an effort to keep it engaging I would love
to hear your feedback, even the most critical feedback I will take positively.
Feel free to get in touch through any of the links on the left.

# Cooking

For around 7 years now I have had an interest in cooking, and for this I need 
to assign a little credit to [James Conolly](https://www.instagram.com/conolly/).
We shared a house together for a little over a year whilst we were working at
BAE Systems and he was always cooking something fancy. After a while I decided
I wanted to try and keep up, and once I got started it was hard to go back to
bad food.

In the past couple of years I found myself being a little lazy when it came to
food. I would order takeaway more often than I was used to, and my home-cooked
dishses weren't as inspiring as they used to be. Hopefully you can appreciate
that after a long working day, a couple of hours shopping and cooking aren't
always so appealing.

Now I am reverting back to an old method that served me well around 5 years ago.
I plan 7 days of meals every Sunday with specific recipies. This means I can go
shopping on the Monday with a precise set of ingredients to buy, and know that
I can make really nice meals every day, usually with enough left over for lunch
the next day!

So from now on I will document these meal plans and take some nice pictures, and
if all goes well hopefully I can inspire you to try some yourself!

# Statistics

When I said engaging content my prior belief tells me that statistics didn't
come to your mind. Given that I am writing this blog in R Blogdown, it should
be possible for me to convince you otherwise in the long run.

At the time of writing I am part of the way through an online course called
[Improving your statistical inferences](https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-inferences/home/welcome).
From my time working at trivago as a Data Scientist I knew deep down that my
lack of statistics knowledge was driving me to bad conclusions more often than
I would like to believe. By the end of the course I hope to be much better in
experiment design, and more importantly drawing statistical inferences!

I promised content and content I shall eventually deliver. As well as doing the
course I am also building a number of small applications to help visualise the
concepts in the course in R shiny. For now it is a work-in-progress, but you
can follow it [right here!](https://github.com/thecasper2/improving_your_statistical_inferences)

# Fitness

I have a rather mixed history with fitness. On the one hand I have enjoyed a
number of fitness activities over my life, I always enjoyed playing football
and I have been a keen cyclist since a teenager. On the other hand I have
suffered a number of injuries over the years: ankle sprains, knee pain, and
most severely a disc herniation in my lower back. On top of this I am not an
ideal weight, I am not hugely overweight but I definitely could do with losing
some.

Much like cooking hopefully you appreciate that after a full working day it is
tough to think about exercise, whether that is going to the gym or even just
walking or cycling home. I decided I am out of excuses to focus on my health,
so now exercise is at the forefront of my activities.

I am attempting to cycle at least twice a week and I record my activities
[on my strava account](https://www.strava.com/athletes/10527204). I would love
for you to follow me and tell me when I am not training hard enough!

The ultimate tracker for this is my weight, it isn't a comprehensive measure of
health but it is certainly an important one. I have some digital scales in the
bathroom and weigh myself most mornings. I am going to upload the data to this
blog, and you can follow my progress on the [weight page](/page/weight).
