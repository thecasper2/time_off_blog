Those that know me well may know that I err on the side of caution when it comes
to things I don't know; they may also know that I'm not Korean.

I usually have a bit of background knowledge about the things I cook, at the
very least I have usually eaten the dishes tens of times. I have only previously
eaten Bibimbap once and it was incredibly tasty, but I really don't know a lot
about the dish. Under usual caution I'm not going to give a detailed history of
the dish but I'll give my expedition into my first time trying to make it and
what I learnt along the way.

The first resource I found was a rather lengthy but informative
[youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QQ67F8y2b8) from a lady called
Maangchi. She was showing the difference between a "normal" Bibimbap and Dolsot
Bibimbap, the latter is assembled in a stone pot and heated further before
serving. It went into a lot of detail and used ingredients like Fernbrake which
I can honestly say I've never heard of before. Top marks for the recipe but it's
not where I wanted to start.

Eventually I found a simpler recipe 
[at this website](https://mykoreankitchen.com/bibimbap-korean-mixed-rice-with-meat-and-assorted-vegetables/).
If you want to try and make the dish then I strongly encourage you to give it a
go. I'm not going to repeat the recipe below but I will share some things I
learnt along the way and the end result; we all know that following recipes
isn't always as simple as it sounds.

# Spinach and Mung Bean Sprouts

There are to subrecipies in the main recipe but they are really easy and by
themselves they actually make really tasty side dishes, they are the seasoned
spinach and mung bean sprouts. Spinach is really easy to pick up in large
amounts at a supermarket, mung bean sprouts I found quite cheaply at
[Tains Asian Supermarket](https://g.page/Tains_DUS?share).

They both cook so quickly; the spinach only needs 30 seconds of boiling.
Afterwards you rinse them both under cold water to stop the cooking. This is
great because they're going to be cold anyway so you don't have to hurry with
the rest of the dish!

The seasoning is really easy too. Sesame seeds, garlic, sesame oil, and spring
onion are all incredibly easy to find.

# Mushrooms

This may not seem like the most exciting part of the dish but it is when you
somehow pick up dried "black fungus". I found it in the Asian supermarket and
thought let's give it a try, it's a jelly-like mushroom and is very dark. I
have found no evidence of its use in making Bibimbap but I can testify to it
being tasty.

Just remember to give it 60 minutes to rehydrate. According to the internet it's
not in any way dangerous but as per the packet instructions I boiled it for 10
minutes by itself, it came out great! This is all an aside, I'm sure shiitake
mushrooms are equally great in the dish.

# The "meat"

I used vegetarian mince for my portion. The main thing to remember is it's a
small component of the dish so you don't need much more than 100g. If you end up
buying 500g then make sure you're making more than one serving or have a plan
for the leftovers.

</center>

Again the seasoning is really easy, soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic and sugar are
once again easy to come by. You can even have the beef raw if you are certain
of the quality and freshness of your beef. For the vegetarian mince I obviously
cooked it, vegetarian beef tartare is a ridiculous concept.

# The easy ingredients

As per the recipe I added some carrots and topped the assembled dish with a
fried egg. There really is nothing fancy here but if you want carrots
"julienned" (it's a form of cutting) then there are many youtube videos on how
to do this neatly. I just sliced the carrots very diagonally to get wide pieces
and then cut them up into matchsticks.

# Gochujang

Gochujang is a Korean red chilli paste. I can't tell you much about the taste
because I completely forgot to look for it. I read somewhere that it's primary
purpose is to add heat to the bibimbap and a good replacement is Sriracha chilli
sauce, which by some miracle I had.

<center>
![This is not Gochugang - Sriracha sauce to the rescue](/post/bibimbap_files/IMG_20200610_114733.jpg){width=50% height=50%}

</center>

Looking at the ingredients in Gochujang it looks quite tasty, so I doubt that
it is only adding heat. I will definitely look for this when I next make
Bibimbap, some may say I didn't even make Bibimbap this time by forgetting it
as an ingredient.

# Rice

I get the impression that slightly sticky rice is better for this dish, that
requires quite a glutinous rice. All I had available was jasmine rice but it
is possible to make it sticky. Doing this is quite simple:

1) Don't wash the rice, the starch on the rice creates the stickiness
2) Use just enough water, for 1 measure (a cup, a mug, a chalice, etc.) of rice
you need two measures of water
3) Put it in boiling water, close the lid, turn the heat down to minimum and
leave it alone for 8 minutes. Do not take the lid off!
4) All the water should be gone, turn off the heat and enjoy

# The final result

Thanks for making it this far, or at the very least just scrolling directly to
the end. All that remained was the assembly process. Line the bottom half of the
bowl with rice, then in sections add the other ingredients, including the
gochujang, and top with a fried egg. I decorated with some chopped spring onion
and toasted seasame seeds.

Then you just mix it all up and enjoy!

And yes, I forgot to add the seaweed that I bought. Many lessons learned here.
