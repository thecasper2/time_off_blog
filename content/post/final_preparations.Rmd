The lack of posts in recent days is mostly due to extensive trip preparations
in advance of a departure on Saturday, but with most of those complete I can
share my exciting plans!

# A New Drone

Naturally this is one of the most exciting parts for me. My other drone, the
Parrot Disco, is very large, hard to transport, and requires a lot of space for
takeoff. Definitely not ideal for capturing footage of wooded areas, beaches,
and places not so accessible by car. After a short amount of research the
obvious travel drone is the DJI Mavic Mini.

With 3 batteries serving approximately 20 minutes of flight-time each, the
possibility to charge via USB in the car, all coming inside a 28x19x8cm carry
case, it's a clear winner. I tested it out on the bank of the Rhein in
Düsseldorf, check out the video below.

# The First Few Stops

In the previous post I embedded my route through Italy and Greece, so if you're
interested in the full route I encourage you to take a look. I just wanted to
focus on the first 3 stops en route.

## Munich

The lesser-visited city in all road trips of Italy, the southern-German city
of Munich is my first stop. This is purely to break up the first big drive,
pay a visit to [James Conolly](https://www.instagram.com/conolly/). I don't
suppose my visit will be particularly cultural, instead likely focusing on
(as he would call it) achieving an advanced state of refreshment.

## The Dolomites

The first Italian stop is
[this campsite in the Dolomites](https://goo.gl/maps/DjcnjwC8PskhyhKr6). The
area is littered with winter ski slopes which I'm hoping delivers some really
nice panoramic views and walking trails in the summer. I was also recommended
the nearby town of
[Ortisei/Urtijëi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urtij%C3%ABi) which has 
[a rather bizarre pronounciation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Urtijei.ogg).

It's also a great opportunity to test out the viability of my tent in warm
weather!

After leaving I'll have a quick chance to visit the highly-rated
[Lake Garda](https://goo.gl/maps/u5TyY4fkvi5XU9Yc9). Aside from being quite
beautiful there appears to be a number of places to swim, ideal for the
underwater GoPro footage!

## Verona

After approximately 3 years I make my return to hostelling with a stay at
[The Hostello in Verona](https://goo.gl/maps/THuhFPw1X7vWFCPF9). During my
2-night stay in the city there are a number of obvious highlights. The obvious
highlight is [The Verona Arena](https://goo.gl/maps/cCxgekaoxdkFrQdG9), a well
preserved Roman amphitheater. Verona is also the setting for Shakespeare's Romeo
& Juliet, a significant number of tourists flock to Juliet's house.

I have read that 1 day is probably enough to see the sights, but it can't hurt
to relax and potentially eat beyond my comfort level.

# The Rest

As I said in the previous post I'm going to keep this blog awash with posts
from the trip. Drone footage, Underwater GoPro footage, tales, photos, history,
I will do my very best to document how the trip goes!
