Drone flying in Germany can be challenging: finding a spot that isn't within a
Naturschutzgebiet, is 100m from a highway, and isn't voilating privacy laws
leaves little room to fly a device that requires at least an 80m radius to
land. But when you do find somewhere it is often rewarding as Germany is
surprisingly green and beautiful.

Yesterday I came across a nice but compact spot near
[Weibersbrunn](https://goo.gl/maps/P2AwEJgN65wSSXvaA), an area that apparently
was (and still seems to be) a timber yard.

The town itself seems to be a small clearing in what is otherwise dense forest.
It didn't leave much space to fly and I was definitely worried about losing my
drone in the trees, but it turned out to be just enough space (and just far
enough from the highway) despite a rather poor landing.

And as a bonus here is a nice picture I took of some old caravan-type thing I
came across on the edge of the forest.
