At the start of 2020 I purchased a
[Parrot Disco fixed-wing drone](https://www.parrot.com/be/drones/parrot-disco-fpv)
from eBay, flying fixed-wing seemed much more exciting than a standard
quadcopter drone. Now that I am the proud owner of a Parrot Disco, I will post
the footage taken below for you to enjoy!

# The Sculpture Hall - Neuss

My first flight at [The Sculpture Hall](https://goo.gl/maps/RtcTrGTtsnR8Z21x9)
near the Museum Island (Museumsinsel - Hombroich) on 09/03/2020.
