At the start of 2020 I purchased a
[Parrot Disco fixed-wing drone](https://www.parrot.com/be/drones/parrot-disco-fpv)
from eBay, flying fixed-wing seemed much more exciting than a standard
quadcopter drone.

Following the successful flights from this drone I decided to buy a more
compact drone, the [DJI Mavic Mini](https://www.dji.com/de/mavic-mini).

Below is a feed of all the footage taken from my drones.
